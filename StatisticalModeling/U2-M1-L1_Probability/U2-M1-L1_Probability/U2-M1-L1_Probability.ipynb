There is only a single occurrence for this event, either it rains, or it doesn't. In such cases, the bayesian interpretation makes more sense. In this interpretation, a probability is a quantified *degree of belief* of how likely is an event to occur. This belief must be based, either implicitly or explicitly, on certain assumptions (also called the *priori*) or evidence. In the rain example, the evidence is our past experience regarding rain around the same time of the year."

    "\n",
    "In most foot races, everyone starts at the same time. If you are a fast runner, you usually pass a lot of people at the beginning of the race, but after a few miles everyone around you is going at the same speed. When I ran a long-distance (209 miles) relay race for the first time, I noticed an odd phenomenon: when I overtook another runner, I was usually much faster, and when another runner overtook me, he was usually much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first I thought that the distribution of speeds might be bimodal; that is, there were many slow runners and many fast runners, but few at my speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I realized that I was the victim of a bias similar to the effect of class size. The race was unusual in two ways: it used a staggered start, so teams started at different times; also, many teams included runners at different levels of ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, runners were spread out along the course with little relationship between speed and location. When I joined the race, the runners near me were (pretty much) a random sample of the runners in the race.\n",
    "\n",
    "So where does the bias come from? During my time on the course, the chance of overtaking a runner, or being overtaken, is proportional to the difference in our speeds. I am more likely to catch a slow runner, and more likely to be caught by a fast runner. But runners at the same speed are unlikely to see each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function called ObservedPmf that takes a Pmf representing the actual distribution of runners' speeds, and the speed of a running observer, and returns a new PMF representing the distribution of runners' speeds as seen by the observer.\n",
